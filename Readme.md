### Full-Stack Challenge from BildauDigital done by Niyobuhungiro Yves

This challenge imagines that we have a social media platform that is under attack from spam. We have implemented a reporting system for users that lets them report spam to the platform, and our spam protection team.

The challenge is to create a small full stack application for our spam protection team that consists of a server and a web based UI in order to manage reported content.
